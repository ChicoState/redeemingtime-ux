# Scenarios

### Sarah Scenario: Overcoming Social Media Distraction for Productivity
Sarah has an important exam coming up. She sits down to study but instinctively opens Instagram, losing track of time. Redeeming Time detects her social media usage and sends her a notification:  
*"You've spent 25 minutes on Instagram. Try a 10-minute focused study session instead!"*  
She decides to follow the app's suggestion and engages in a Pomodoro-style study session. After completing it, she earns a badge for successfully redirecting her attention. She later checks her daily time insights and realizes how much time she saved by staying on task.

### Jerry Scenario: Building Healthy Habits for a Balanced Workday
Jerry, a remote freelancer, often struggles with structuring his day. He starts his morning by checking his phone, only to find himself scrolling through Twitter for 30 minutes.  
Today, he receives a custom daily prompt from Redeeming Time:  
*"Start your day with intention! Take 5 minutes to plan your top five goals."*  
He takes the prompt seriously and writes down his goals for the day. Later, the app tracks his screen time and notifies him that he's spent too much time on YouTube. Motivated by the gamification feature, he challenges himself to complete three intentional activities before the end of the day to earn a streak bonus.  
At the end of the week, he sees his progress reflected in his time insights, showing reduced social media usage and increased productive time.
