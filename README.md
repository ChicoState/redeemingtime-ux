# Redeeming Time

People spend the majority of their free time scrolling on social media timelessly. Our goal is to create a platform that pushes people to use their time intentionally by giving the user daily prompts or activities.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

- Competitive analysis showed that existing solutions focus on **blocking distractions** rather than **encouraging intentional time use** through positive habit formation.  
- Heuristic evaluation of competitor **Way of Life** showed strength in tracking but weakness in **engagement mechanics and community-driven motivation.**  
- Users require a balance between structure and flexibility, preferring tools that provide **personalized prompts** rather than strict restrictions.  
- Gamification and **progress tracking (streaks, rewards, community interaction)** increase user engagement and motivation.  
- Development of personas and scenarios reinforced key insights:  
  - Users prefer a **proactive, guidance-based app** over one that simply blocks distractions.  
  - Customization, **reminders, and visual progress tracking** are essential for long-term adoption.  
- The Sketches and Diagrams implement a visually engaging interface with **personalized activity** suggestions, **gamification elements (streaks, badges, leaderboards)**, and intuitive **progress tracking** to encourage intentional time use.
