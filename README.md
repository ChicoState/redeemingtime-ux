# Redeeming Time

People spend the majority of their free time scrolling on social media timelessly. Our goal is to create a platform that pushes people to use their time intentionally by giving the user daily prompts or activities.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

- Competitive analysis showed that existing solutions focus on **blocking distractions** rather than **encouraging intentional time use** through positive habit formation.  
- Heuristic evaluation of competitor **Way of Life** showed strength in tracking but weakness in **engagement mechanics and community-driven motivation.**  
- Users require a balance between structure and flexibility, preferring tools that provide **personalized prompts** rather than strict restrictions.  
- Gamification and **progress tracking (streaks, rewards, community interaction)** increase user engagement and motivation.  
- Development of personas and scenarios reinforced key insights:  
  - Users prefer a **proactive, guidance-based app** over one that simply blocks distractions.  
  - Customization, **reminders, and visual progress tracking** are essential for long-term adoption.  
- The Sketches and Diagrams implement a visually engaging interface with **personalized activity** suggestions, **gamification elements (streaks, badges, leaderboards)**, and intuitive **progress tracking** to encourage intentional time use.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

- Two independent cognitive walkthroughs using the **Jerry Anderson persona** revealed key usability issues in the login flow, dashboard clarity, and activity interaction feedback.  
- Evaluators found the app's core structure intuitive but noted **confusion due to unclear labels**, lack of feedback when starting activities, and ambiguous terminology like “Favorites” and “User Reviews.”  
- The **reward screen (badges, streaks, leaderboard)** was well received and validated the value of gamification for long-term engagement and motivation.  
- Key design updates include:  
  - **Reordering login fields** to follow standard conventions (username before password)  
  - **Adding confirmation steps and descriptions** before starting an activity  
  - **Improving terminology** and adding microcopy or tooltips to clarify dashboard features  
- These refinements will ensure that the interaction flow is more predictable, the interface communicates clearly, and the app better supports **intentional time use through guided, motivational features.**

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

- Six participants completed a structured usability test using our prototype. Each user performed five core tasks and shared real time thoughts using a think-aloud protocol.  
- The login experience was consistently rated as intuitive and aligned well with user expectations.  
- Participants understood the dashboard at a glance but expressed confusion with the **\"View All Data\"** button and desired clearer insight into what leisure time means.  
- On the activities page, **Favorites** and **User Reviews** were well received but often missed due to their low placement. Terminology like **\"Pomodoro\"** also required more explanation.  
- The **rewards page (badges, streaks, leaderboard)** was considered motivating, but navigation redundancies and a lack of clarity in how rewards are earned reduced effectiveness.  
- Participants found the overall concept strong and the UI polished but requested improvements in button labeling, navigation consistency, and interactivity cues.  
- This testing validated key parts of the design (gamification, progress tracking) and identified targeted areas for future refinement.
