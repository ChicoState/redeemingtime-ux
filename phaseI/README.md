# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Redeeming Time is an application designed to help users become more intentional with their free time by reducing unproductive social media usage. The app provides personalized daily prompts, progress tracking, and gamification features such as streaks and community competition to encourage meaningful activities. By nudging users toward goal oriented behavior, Redeeming Time aims to enhance productivity, mindfulness, and community engagement.

## Methods

To develop a user centered design, we conducted multiple research methods to understand competitor offerings, user needs, and effective interaction models.

The first research method we conducted was a competitive analysis, where we examined various applications that address digital well being and productivity. We focused on four key competitors: Way of Life, One Sec, Freedom, and Intention. Each competitor was evaluated based on their strengths, weaknesses, quality, and platform availability. Additionally, we identified gaps that existing products failed to address, such as the lack of gamification features, community driven motivation, and automation for building habits. These insights helped shape the core value propositions of our applications.

Another method we used was heuristic evaluation. We selected Way of Life as the most relevant competitor for an in depth usability assessment. This evaluation focused on how the app interacts with users, its ease of use, and how well it prevents errors. Using standard usability principles, we rated the application on User Control Freedom, Consistency and Standards, and Design. Each category was scored on a scale from 1 to 10, with detailed notes on its strengths, such as strong habit tracking and visual feedback, as well as its weaknesses, including limited flexibility and lack of engagement features. These findings highlighted areas where our application could provide a more user friendly and engaging experience.

We also conducted user research by developing personas to better understand our target audience. The UX team created detailed user profiles representing different demographics, such as college students, freelancers, parents, and professionals. Each persona included a backstory, personality traits, and specific goals related to time management and reducing unproductive social media usage. Additionally, we created real world scenarios demonstrating how users might engage with our application to improve their daily routines, increase awareness of their time usage, and stay motivated through progress tracking and community accountability.

Finally, we performed sketching and ideation to design an intuitive interface that integrates our research findings. The final design incorporated personalized activity suggestions, gamification elements, and progress tracking to maximize engagement and long term / versatile user adoption. These research methods provided a structured foundation for the appâ€™s initial design, ensuring that it aligns with user expectations and differentiates itself from existing solutions.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
