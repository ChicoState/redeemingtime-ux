# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Redeeming Time is an application designed to help users become more intentional with their free time by reducing unproductive social media usage. The app provides personalized daily prompts, progress tracking, and gamification features such as streaks and community competition to encourage meaningful activities. By nudging users toward goal oriented behavior, Redeeming Time aims to enhance productivity, mindfulness, and community engagement.

## Methods

To develop a user-centered design, we conducted multiple research methods to understand competitor offerings, user needs, and effective interaction models.

The first research method we conducted was a competitive analysis, where we examined various applications that address digital well-being and productivity. We focused on four key competitors: "Way of Life", "One Sec", "Freedom", and "Intention". Each competitor was evaluated based on their strengths, weaknesses, quality, and platform availability. Additionally, we identified gaps that existing products failed to address, such as the lack of gamification features, community-driven motivation, and automation for building habits. These insights helped shape the core value propositions of our applications.

Another method we used was heuristic evaluation. We selected Way of Life as the most relevant competitor for an in-depth usability assessment. This evaluation focused on how the app interacts with users, its ease of use, and how well it prevents errors. Using standard usability principles, we rated the application on User Control Freedom, Consistency and Standards, and Design. Each category was scored on a scale from 1 to 10, with detailed notes on its strengths, such as strong habit tracking and visual feedback, as well as its weaknesses, including limited flexibility and lack of engagement features. These findings highlighted areas where our application could provide a more user-friendly and engaging experience.

We also conducted user research by developing personas to better understand our target audience. The UX team created detailed user profiles representing different demographics, such as college students, freelancers, parents, and professionals. Each persona included a backstory, personality traits, and specific goals related to time management and reducing unproductive social media usage. Additionally, we created real-world scenarios demonstrating how users might engage with our application to improve their daily routines, increase awareness of their time usage, and stay motivated through progress tracking and community accountability.

Finally, we performed sketching and ideation to design an intuitive interface that integrates our research findings. The final design incorporated personalized activity suggestions, gamification elements, and progress tracking to maximize engagement and long-term/versatile user adoption. These research methods provided a structured foundation for the app’s initial design, ensuring that it aligns with user expectations and differentiates itself from existing solutions.

## Findings

Through competitive analysis, our UX team found that the demographic that may use "Redeeming The Time" includes those who struggle with time management and seek structured guidance to improve productivity. For individuals striving to keep track of their habits, organize tasks, and create long-term goals, “Redeeming The Time” is a beneficial app.  Based on our competitive analysis, we were able to find the strengths and weaknesses of  “Way of Life”, “One Sec, and “Intention”. These apps introduce a 10-second pause before accessing selected apps, encouraging mindful usage, but they do not allow users to join a community or receive long-term habit reinforcement.

  Findings from our heuristic evaluation of the “Way of Life” app indicated a very clear status by using red for bad habits and green for good habits while using real-world user tracking. They used red for their check mark (yes) and green for their x (no). This showed that the app performed well in system visibility and real-world matching, scoring 8 out of 10 on our heuristic evaluation scale. However, the application scored lower (6 out of 10) in critical areas, including recognition, flexibility, efficiency, and error prevention. The app could benefit from more warning signs and confirmation prompts before users delete habits, which would help prevent accidental deletions and improve user confidence. Users unfamiliar with the icons find navigation difficult. Adding clearer labels or tooltips could enhance usability and reduce confusion. While users can manually set their schedules, greater personalization—such as automated recommendations based on habits—could improve efficiency and user engagement.
  
  To validate our competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation findings in real-world contexts, we developed two representative personas: Sarah James, a busy college student, and Jerry Anderson, a remote freelancer. These personas allowed us to test our findings against specific user needs and scenarios. Struggling to balance her school, social, and personal life, Sarah often spends excessive time on social media instead of studying; the app aligns her activities with her academic goals by providing structured plans and rewards to keep her on track. If her goal is to be more intentional with her studies, the app can create a plan that encourages her to stay on track with rewards.  Jerry works from home but struggles with time management. He's easily distracted by social media, resulting in countless hours on his phone. The app tracks Jerry's social media usage patterns and implements a customizable notification system that alerts him when he exceeds his predetermined time limits, helping him refocus on his intended tasks. Jerry’s ability to set personal goals for himself can provide an incentive to stay on task and not procrastinate. The customizable feature within the app can help him track both work and personal growth activities.


## Conclusions

Based on the heuristic evaluation, we have determined that improving flexibility, clear icons for navigation, and personalized activity recommendations are key to enhancing our application for the user. We discovered that the demographic of users are individuals who struggle with time management, for example, college students, freelancers, and remote workers. Our app must focus on providing structure while preventing the users from overexerting themselves. Creating automated tracking, smart reminders, and a user-friendly interface will allow the user to engage with the app stress-free. Additionally, customizable goal-setting, streak-based motivation, and social accountability features can reinforce and encourage long-term habits. Due to users' doom scrolling, implementing a real-time notification when excessive screen time is detected prompts users to refocus on intentional activities. 


## Caveats

The Caveats we recognized were limited direct user testing, vast target audience, and biases through our heuristic analysis. Since we haven’t tested real users, our findings are based on our competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation. Despite it being a strong foundation, conducting real user testing will help us tailor our app to the users' needs. This would allow us to narrow down who our target audience is. Expectations may differ between students, freelancers, and professionals. Having an idea of who we are prioritizing will help us tailor the app for the needs that best suit them while building a stronger selling pitch.
