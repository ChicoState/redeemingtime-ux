# Phase III: Usability Evaluation

## Introduction

In Phase III, we conducted a usability evaluation of our prototype for **Redeeming Time**, focusing on validating and refining core interactions. This phase builds on our earlier user research and wireframe testing, aiming to assess the prototype’s clarity, usability, and alignment with user mental models. The evaluation used a formative approach with a think-aloud protocol to capture both task performance and qualitative insights.

## Methods

### Overall Approach

We used a **formative, think-aloud usability study** with six participants representing our target users. Each participant was guided through a series of scripted tasks using our interactive prototype. Sessions were moderated for note-taking purposes. Observations, completion success, and subjective ease ratings were logged in a structured spreadsheet.

### Tasks and UX Goals

- **Task 1: Sign into account**  
  *Goal:* Test clarity of login flow and consistency with user expectations  
  *UX Focus:* Learnability, form design

- **Task 2: Find progress/time usage**  
  *Goal:* Evaluate clarity of time tracking and insight summaries  
  *UX Focus:* Dashboard hierarchy, data visibility

- **Task 3: Locate “Favorites” and “User Reviews”**  
  *Goal:* Determine if users can find and interpret activity metadata  
  *UX Focus:* Terminology, navigation, information grouping

- **Task 4: Locate streaks, badges earned, and leaderboard**  
  *Goal:* Understand user interpretation of gamification feedback  
  *UX Focus:* Feedback clarity, reward motivation

- **Task 5: Explore on your own**  
  *Goal:* Gather open-ended impressions and interface intuitiveness  
  *UX Focus:* Aesthetic impression, real-world use simulation

## Findings

### Quantitative Summary

| Task | Completion | Avg. Ease Score (1-5) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Task 1 | 6/6 | 5.0 |
| Task 2 | 4/6 | 3.67 |
| Task 3 | 5/6 | 4.08 |
| Task 4 | 4/6 | 4.17 |
| Task 5 | 6/6 | 3.75 |

### Participant Comments (Summarized)

- **Task 1:** Login flow was intuitive and matched expectations.  
- **Task 2:** Dashboard was clear, but “View All Data” was non-functional or confusing for many users.  
- **Task 3:** Favorites/User Reviews were understood, but their placement at the bottom made them easy to miss. Terminology like “Pomodoro” could use explanation.  
- **Task 4:** Users liked rewards but found navigation redundant and wanted more explanation on how rewards are earned.  
- **Task 5:** Users liked the polished UI and concept, but found activities overwhelming and desired more clarity in interaction feedback and navigation.

## Conclusions

### A.) Recommended Changes

- Fix or remove non-functional buttons like “View All Data”
- Move “Favorites” and “User Reviews” higher on the activities page
- Add microcopy or tooltips to terms like “Pomodoro” or “Leaderboard”
- Clarify redundant icons or sections on the rewards page
- Implement confirmation or feedback when starting activities

### B.) Features to Keep

- Login screen and its flow
- Summary dashboard showing productive vs. leisure time
- Rewards system: streaks, badges, leaderboard
- Aesthetic and conceptual design

### Caveats

- Some prototype buttons were not functional, which affected user understanding
- Participants mostly reflected college student and freelancer demographics, not all personas
- Observations were collected via moderated think-aloud sessions only; unmoderated testing might yield different insights
- The evaluation focused on early design feedback, not performance metrics
