# Phase III: Usability Evaluation

## Introduction

In Phase III, we conducted a usability evaluation of our prototype for **Redeeming Time**, focusing on validating and refining core interactions. This phase builds on our earlier user research and wireframe testing, aiming to assess the prototype’s clarity, usability, and alignment with user mental models. The evaluation used a formative approach with a think-aloud protocol to capture both task performance and qualitative insights.

## Methods

### Overall Approach

We used a **formative, think-aloud usability study** with six participants representing our target users. Our interactive prototype guided Each participant through a series of scripted tasks. Sessions were moderated for note-taking purposes. Observations, completion success, and subjective ease ratings were logged in a structured spreadsheet.

### Tasks and UX Goals

- **Task 1: Sign into account**  
  *Goal:* Test clarity of login flow and consistency with user expectations  
  *UX Focus:* Learnability, form design

- **Task 2: Find progress/time usage**  
  *Goal:* Evaluate clarity of time tracking and insight summaries  
  *UX Focus:* Dashboard hierarchy, data visibility

- **Task 3: Locate “Favorites” and “User Reviews”**  
  *Goal:* Determine if users can find and interpret activity metadata  
  *UX Focus:* Terminology, navigation, information grouping

- **Task 4: Locate streaks, badges earned, and leaderboard**  
  *Goal:* Understand user interpretation of gamification feedback  
  *UX Focus:* Feedback clarity, reward motivation

- **Task 5: Explore on your own**  
  *Goal:* Gather open-ended impressions and interface intuitiveness  
  *UX Focus:* Aesthetic impression, real-world use simulation

## Findings

### Quantitative Summary

| Task | Completion | Avg. Ease Score (1-5) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Task 1 | 6/6 | 5.0 |
| Task 2 | 4/6 | 3.67 |
| Task 3 | 5/6 | 4.08 |
| Task 4 | 4/6 | 4.17 |
| Task 5 | 6/6 | 3.75 |

### Participant Comments (Summarized)

- **Task 1:** Login flow was intuitive and matched expectations.  
- **Task 2:** Dashboard was clear, but “View All Data” was non-functional or confusing for many users.  
- **Task 3:** Favorites/User Reviews were understood, but their placement at the bottom made them easy to miss. Terminology like “Pomodoro” could use explanation.  
- **Task 4:** Users liked rewards but found navigation redundant and wanted more explanation on how rewards are earned.  
- **Task 5:** Users liked the polished UI and concept, but found activities overwhelming and desired more clarity in interaction feedback and navigation.

## Conclusions

The usability evaluation of the Redeeming The Time prototype brought clarity, revealing that the application needs to be re-evaluated and improved. Through the five tasks given, participants generally successfully navigated the core features, especially the login flow, which all participants completed successfully with a perfect score. However, when asked to do more intricate tasks, we received mixed emotions, including interacting with the dashboard and certain gamification aspects.  While most users were able to locate features like “Favorites,” “User Reviews,” and “Badges,” there was a notable drop in scores and completion rates for tasks that required engaging with layered or nested information. Prime examples are the “View All Data” button and the placement of favorites and reviews.

Users did not understand how to earn rewards and streaks. The main takeaways are that although the app's foundation is solid, it needs to be refined further, specifically by providing positive or negative feedback for the user through the application. To work through these findings, running another user test to confirm the changes we plan to implement and understand how a user may use the app would be very beneficial.

### Caveats

After completing the evaluation, multiple limitations must be acknowledged. The prototype, which was tested through Figma, was not fully interactive. It could not simulate real-time responses and provide active feedback, which impacted the user's perception of the application's interactivity and fullness. Due to these constraints, we could not get data on long-term engagements and discoverability that you would measure over time. The sample size was not random and lacked diversity. It did not represent the audience we are striving to use the application.

All the users who used our prototype were male, which showed bias in their understanding and behavior towards the app. We cannot generalize what we learned since we did not have female users and a greater age representation. Redeeming Time is designed for a broad audience, including professionals, parents, and non-technical users. Our findings provide only a partial view of its usability across target areas.
